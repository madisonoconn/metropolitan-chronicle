				Following test results revealing PFAS levels more than 20 times higher than the EPA's lifetime health advisory, Parchment residents say they're not surprised to learn their drinking water was contaminated.
				<br><br>
				"It's probably been here for years," said Larry Fike, who lives in a portion of Cooper Township that relies on the neighboring city's water supply.
				<br><br>
				On Thursday, Parchment and Cooper Township residents who rely on the municipal water supply were told to immediately stop drinking the water. Results from a Michigan Department of Environmental Quality test showed per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known collectively as PFAS, in Parchment's municipal water supply at levels of 1,587 parts per trillion.
				<br><br>
				That level is more than 20 times higher than the EPA's lifetime health advisory of 70 ppt.
				<br><br>
				"I'm not surprised that stuff like that seeped out like that into the ground or into the river or into some system," Fike said. "But I've never had a problem with the water."
				<br><br>
				Following a local state of emergency declared Saturday and a state of emergency declared by Michigan officials on Sunday, Parchment residents, who have been cautioned against drinking or cooking with the contaminated water, are picking up free bottled water distributed at Parchment High School.
				<br><br>
				Some residents are more concerned than others.
				<br><br>
				Michelle Harmon and her family moved to Parchment in November. She said she's worried for her kids, who are 7, 14 and 15, and for her dog.
				<br><br>
				Harmon's family switched over to only using bottled water to drink and cook, and she is tearing out her garden because the foods were grown with contaminated water. Though public health officials have said residents should have no concerns about using the water for showers or baths, her family decided to bathe elsewhere.
				<br><br>
				"It breaks your heart because you feel like you did it, even though we didn't do it -- like I poisoned my own family by paying the water company, who I thought was giving me clean water," Harmon said. "I feel like I can't trust what God has given us to stay alive."
				<br><br>
				She is trying to stay active on the issue and has been doing her own research. More than anything, she said she wants accountability.
				<br><br>
				"I want to know if they've found a location as to where it's coming from and if it's multiple locations," Harmon said. "I want answers and a real plan of action. I think that's what everyone really wants at this point."
				<br><br>
				Fike, on the other hand, said the presence of PFAS in his water is not a huge concern. He has lived in Parchment for more than 50 years.
				<br><br>
				"Everyone wants to blame the paper mill, but I don't know," said Fike, who worked at Parchment's namesake paper mill for around 35 years. "I'm 67 years old and I drank this water since I was 5. What can I say? I'm still here."
				<br><br>
				Parchment is named for a once-operational paper plant located in the city. Though some have pointed to the shuttered plant as a possible source of PFAS contamination, the site -- or sites -- being investigated as the source of PFAS contamination have not yet been identified by state or local officials.
				<br><br>
				The changes Fike has made since Thursday have been simple, he said, like pouring bottled water into the coffee maker and using it for his cats instead of tap water.
				<br><br>
				"I'm concerned now because I'm learning what's going on and what this means, but for 50 years I've been drinking this water," he said.
				<br><br>
				Fike has picked up cases of bottled water from the distribution site at Parchment High School every other day.
				<br><br>
				Volunteers will continue to hand out free water at Parchment High School, 1916 East G Ave., for the rest of the week, between the hours of noon and 8 p.m.
				<br><br>
				Organizers are frequently re-evaluating the need and demand for the bottled water, said Kalamazoo County Clerk and Treasurer Shannon Stutz, who has coordinated volunteer efforts.
				<br><br>
				Stutz said the community has been responsive in mobilizing, and most of the time, people reach out to her to ask how they can help.
				<br><br>
				"Every day, they're checking where we're at and how much is left," Stutz said. "We are scheduled right now Monday through Friday this week, and I haven't heard yet what the hours are going to be yet on the weekend, but they're planning it through Sunday."
				<br><br>
				She said, at this point, Parchment residents should know not to drink the city's water.
				<br><br>
				"I just feel like we need to give the authorities enough time to get down to the source," Stutz said.
				<br><br>
				Debbie Galbreath has owned Geno's Golden Pizza and Pub for 10 years. The restaurant is in the center of town and only a block from the paper mill that helped build it. Galbreath said she was not surprised to hear about the high levels of PFAS in the city's water, because of the presence of factories and mills in Parchment.
				<br><br>
				The local health department came to her restaurant Thursday night, Galbreath said, when information was first released about contamination in Parchment's drinking water. Because they were not able to use tap water to make their dough, they lost inventory they had prepared that same morning.
				<br><br>
				"All that dough, scraped into the garbage," Galbreath said. "Plus the sauce, the spaghetti, the rice, everything we made with the water. So not only losing that kind of money and inventory and being behind on the dough, but we have to purchase extra jugs of water for the other stuff."
				<br><br>
				Now, the restaurant is buying jugs of water to make their dough and other foods.
				<br><br>
				"Who knows how long this has been going on. Probably a long time," Galbreath said. "Nothing I can do about it."
				<br><br>
				Some residents in the affected area have their own private drinking water wells not owned by the city. Rand Riggs is one of them.
				<br><br>
				Riggs moved to the area in 1980 and said he has been raising and selling livestock since he and his wife moved to Parchment. Riggs said he's not upset or worried about the issue.
				<br><br>
				"It didn't just happen overnight," Riggs said. "I would be very surprised if I'm affected by it."
				<br><br>
				His private well is one of the wells being tested because it's within a one mile radius of Parchment's wells, which were tested to confirm the presence of PFAS contamination.
				<br><br>
				Officials said results from those follow-up tests were expected Monday, July 30, though Kalamazoo County Health and Community Services Administrator James Rutherford said <a class="red" href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2018/07/parchment_pfas_well_results.html">he had not received them</a> as of 6:50 p.m. Monday.
				<br><br>
				A town hall meeting will be held Tuesday at Haven Reformed Church, 5350 Sprinkle Road. The open house will be from 5-6 p.m. and a program will run from 6 to 8:30 p.m.
				<br><br>
				The meeting will update Parchment and Cooper Township residents on the response to PFAS contamination and plans for interim and long-term water supply solutions.
				<br><br>
				Officials from the city of Kalamazoo reported Monday that work is already beginning on a project to connect the larger city's water system to Parchment's to supply safe drinking water as an "interim" step.
				<br><br>
				Parchment residents are encouraged to call the local water hotline at 269-373-5346 with questions or for additional information.
