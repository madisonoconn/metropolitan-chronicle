				For Goodland residents, nothing marks the start of summer quite like Spammy Jammy, the hurricane prevention party at the <a class="red" href="http://www.littlebarrestaurant.com/">Little Bar Restaurant</a> each year.
				<br><br>
				Saturday’s Spammy Jammy event had what every great hurricane party has: pajamas, alcohol, music and a lot of Spam.
				<br><br>
				“It’s like a hurricane party where you’re just at home in your pajamas with the canned food,” said Angela Scalici, manager at the Little Bar. “We figure if we have the hurricane party before it comes, then maybe the hurricane won’t come.”
				<br><br>
				The first Spammy Jammy was held when a hurricane came through in the 1990s, said Niki Bauer, co-owner of the Little Bar.
				<br><br>
				“A lot of the locals came to the bar in their pajamas, and we got some Spam out of the grocery store, and it started these big parties,” Bauer said.
				<br><br>
				So far, the tradition has seemed to work. Even during <a class="red" href="https://www.naplesnews.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2018/09/07/hurricane-irma-one-year-later-naples-marco-island-florida/1224427002/">Hurricane Irma</a>, the Little Bar didn’t have flooding, Scalici said.
				<br><br>
				Spam isn’t offered on the menu, but the event features a Spam art contest and a Spam cooking contest each year. Entries are assessed by a panel of judges, and winners receive gift certificates to the restaurant.
				<br><br>
				Food entries ranged from Spam fries to Spam cupcakes to Spam Bloody Marys. This year’s art entries included a Spam birthday cake celebrating the Little Bar’s 40th anniversary, a tri-fold display of the history of Spam and “Spenga” — Jenga with blocks made of Spam.
				<br><br>
				“It’s a fun thing, this Spammy Jammy,” Goodland resident Kathleen Duffy said. “Officially, I’m retired, but I cheated and I worked three nights a week here during the season. … I’ve worked here since 1991, and I’ve come every year.”
				<br><br>
				And, of course, there are the pajamas.
				<br><br>
				“A lot of people come in their pajamas,” Scalici said. “There’s a few people that really don’t know what’s going on, they just happen to make a reservation on that night, but we let them know.”
				<br><br>
				The party runs until 1 a.m., with a good turnout. Throughout the night, the Little Bar will see 100 to 200 people in the dining room and another 100 at the bar, Scalici said.
				<br><br>
				By 5 p.m. Saturday, every seat at the bar was filled, every table was taken and a dozen other people milled around, examining the Spam entries.
				<br><br>
				Spammy Jammy is followed by Spamover, an all-day after-party on Sunday, Bauer said. Spamover is truly the last hurrah, when the Little Bar tries to run out of what it didn’t sell before closing up shop until the fall.
				<br><br>
				“It’s our farewell to our customers, since we won’t get to see them. Everyone comes out, and we get to see the locals and our regulars and say goodbye to them until the fall,” Scalici said. “I think Spammy Jammy is more of the first day of summer than anything else.”
