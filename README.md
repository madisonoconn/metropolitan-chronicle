I designed this mock newspaper website for a journalism class at Michigan State University. Although the assignment was to create and design a web portfolio, I wanted to challenge myself, so with support from my professor, I built this mock newspaper site from the ground up. It's not perfect, but I'm happy with it as a first attempt at coding a news website.

## Outcome
I put many hours of work into this one. <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/madisonoconn/metropolitan-chronicle/48338aaf5dadf460cf6246759c4a46296e2a05f7/index.html">Take a look</a>.

## Project status
Is any project ever really done? Even though I've "finished" this project, there are still a few things I might go back and clean up.

## Authors
I created this site in Fall 2019 for my "Design for Web and Mobile" journalism class.
